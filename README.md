### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The labs definitely did introduce various topics needed to complete the assignmemt. Lab 3 was especially helpful in introducing APIs. It gave me a basic idea of what to do, despite not finishing both the lab and this project. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, then I would've liked to be able to sort the movies by trending, in theaters, by genre, etc.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I had a much harder time implementing the back-end over the interface. I thought it would be much simpler than t really was, considering everyone else managed to get the bare minimum features working faily quickly.
